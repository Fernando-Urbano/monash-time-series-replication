# About this project

*[TO DO]*

# Quick Start
## 1. Install TexLive
Note that you must have TexLive installed on your computer and available in your path.

It can be downloaded in:
- [Windows installer](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html#install)
- [Mac installer](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)

## 2. Create virtual environment
Go to the home directory of the project and type in terminal the following commands:

```bash
conda deactivate
conda create -n mtsr -c conda-forge python=3.8.5 r-base=4.0.3
conda activate mtsr
```

The versions specified of R and Python are the closest available for `osx-arm64` to the original project (R: 4.0.2; Python: 3.7.4).

After activating the virtual environment

## 3. Install the required packages
For Python we use `pip` to install the required packages:

### 3.1. Python
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.2. R
Install homebrew if not installed:
```bash
if test ! $(which brew); then
  echo "Installing homebrew..."
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
fi
```

Install required tools:
```bash
# List of necessary tools and libraries
tools=(
  gcc # includes gfortran
  cmake
  libomp
)

# Install necessary tools and libraries if they are not installed
for tool in "${tools[@]}"; do
  if brew list $tool &>/dev/null; then
    echo "$tool is installed."
  else
    echo "Installing $tool..."
    brew install $tool
  fi
done

# Check for Xcode Command Line Tools and install if not found
if ! xcode-select -p &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Xcode Command Line Tools not found. Installing..."
  xcode-select --install
else
  echo "Xcode Command Line Tools are installed."
fi

echo "All necessary tools and libraries are checked and installed."
```

Install R packages:
```bash
Rscript install_packages.R
```





You can then navigate to the `src` directory and then run 
```
doit
```
# General Directory Structure

 - The `assets` folder is used for things like hand-drawn figures or other pictures that were not generated from code. These things cannot be easily recreated if they are deleted.

 - The `output` folder, on the other hand, contains tables and figures that are generated from code. The entire folder should be able to be deleted, because the code can be run again, which would again generate all of the contents.

 - I'm using the `doit` Python module as a task runner. It works like `make` and the associated `Makefile`s. To rerun the code, install `doit` (https://pydoit.org/) and execute the command `doit` from the `src` directory. Note that doit is very flexible and can be used to run code commands from the command prompt, thus making it suitable for projects that use scripts written in multiple different programming languages.

 - I'm using the `.env` file as a container for absolute paths that are private to each collaborator in the project. You can also use it for private credentials, if needed. It should not be tracked in Git.

# Data and Output Storage

I'll often use a separate folder for storing data. I usually write code that will pull the data and save it to a directory in the data folder called "pulled"  to let the reader know that anything in the "pulled" folder could hypothetically be deleted and recreated by rerunning the PyDoit command (the pulls are in the dodo.py file).

I'll usually store manually created data in the "assets" folder if the data is small enough. Because of the risk of manually data getting changed or lost, I prefer to keep it under version control if I can.

Output is stored in the "output" directory. This includes tables, charts, and rendered notebooks. When the output is small enough, I'll keep this under version control. I like this because I can keep track of how tables change as my analysis progresses, for example.

Of course, the data directory and output directory can be kept elsewhere on the machine. To make this easy, I always include the ability to customize these locations by defining the path to these directories in environment variables, which I intend to be defined in the `.env` file, though they can also simply be defined on the command line or elsewhere. The `config.py` is reponsible for loading these environment variables and doing some like preprocessing on them. The `config.py` file is the entry point for all other scripts to these definitions. That is, all code that references these variables and others are loading by importing `config`.


# Dependencies and Virtual Environments

## Working with `pip` requirements

`conda` allows for a lot of flexibility, but can often be slow. `pip`, however, is fast for what it does.  You can install the requirements for this project using the `requirements.txt` file specified here. Do this with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements file can be created like this:
```
pip list --format=freeze
```

## Working with `conda` environments

The dependencies used in this environment (along with many other environments commonly used in data science) are stored in the conda environment called `blank` which is saved in the file called `environment.yml`. To create the environment from the file (as a prerequisite to loading the environment), use the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now, to load the environment, use

```
conda activate blank
```

Note that an environment file can be created with the following command:

```
conda env export > environment.yml
```

However, it's often preferable to create an environment file manually, as was done with the file in this project.

Also, these dependencies are also saved in `requirements.txt` for those that would rather use pip. Also, GitHub actions work better with pip, so it's nice to also have the dependencies listed here. This file is created with the following command:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Alternative Quickstart using Conda
Another way to  run code in this repo is to use the following steps.
First, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project and create a conda environment using the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Now, load the environment with
```
conda activate blank
```
Now, navigate to the directory called `src`
and run
```
doit
```
That should be it!



**Other helpful `conda` commands**

- Create conda environment from file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Activate environment for this project: `conda activate blank`
- Remove conda environment: `conda remove --name myenv --all`
- Create blank conda environment: `conda create --name myenv --no-default-packages`
- Create blank conda environment with different version of Python: `conda create --name myenv --no-default-packages python` Note that the addition of "python" will install the most up-to-date version of Python. Without this, it may use the system version of Python, which will likely have some packages installed already.

## `mamba` and `conda` performance issues

Since `conda` has so many performance issues, it's recommended to use `mamba` instead. I recommend installing the `miniforge` distribution. See here: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge
